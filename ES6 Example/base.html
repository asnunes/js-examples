    <h3>Content</h3>
    <p>Suppose that you're working in a small town administration and you're in charge of two town elements:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Park</li>
        <li>Streets</li>
    </ol>

    <p>It's a very small town, so right now there are only 3 parks and 4 streets. All parks and streets have a name
    and a build year.</p>

    <p>At and end-of-year meeting, your boss wants a final report with the following:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Tree density of each park in town (formula: number of trees / park area )</li>
        <li>Average age of each town's park (formula: sum of all ages / number of parks)</li>
        <li>The name of the park that has more thean 1000 trees</li>
        <li>Total and average length of the town's streets</li>
        <li>Size classification of all streets: tiny/small/normal/big/huge. If size is unknow, the default is normal</li>
    </ol>

    All the report data should be printed to the console.
